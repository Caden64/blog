# Why
This is my website where I have my portfolio works.
The website is made with the Astro web framework which generates static HTML, JS, and CSS.
I chose Astro based on a want for ease of use and good developer experience. 


# Developer Experience
I started this project in VSCode before migrating all of my projects to various JetBrains IDE's.
This project is maintained in WebStorm which has a new plugin for minimal Astro support.

### WebStorm
JetBrains Astro plugin is lackluster in comparison to support on VSCode and JetBrains support for more popular web frameworks such as React, Vue, and Svelte all of which I have use and liked.
Tailwind is my preference for css tools and the Astro plugin does not communicate with the Tailwind plugin for QoL things such as colors swatches by the line numbers which changes the work flow of the developer.

### VSCode
Everything just worked with VSCode however I switched because I prefer the ecosystem around JetBrains IDE's with a more polished feeling experience in the beta new UI.
The Astro support was wonderful tailwind just worked and was able to find some snippet extensions in the extension explorer.
