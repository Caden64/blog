## Installing Python and VSCode

In order to install python you must got to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of python. Once you have downloaded python you can install it by running the installer. I recommend using vscode as your text editor for python. You can download vscode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Once you have installed vscode you can install the python extension by searching for it in the extensions tab.

## Hello World

Open a new file in vscode and save it as `hello.py`. In the file type the following code:

```python
print("Hello World")
```

in the top right there should be a green play button. Click it and you should see "Hello World" printed in the terminal.
